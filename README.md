## Description

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

## Key Features

- Random Word Selection: The game enhances excitement by selecting a mystery word randomly from a predefined list, ensuring a diverse range of words for players to guess.

- Adjustable Difficulty: Tailor the game to your preference by customizing the number of lives a player has, allowing you to make the gameplay easier or more challenging according to your skill level.

- User-Friendly Interface: The game offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, guiding players with clear instructions and providing helpful feedback throughout the guessing process.

- Letter Tracking: Stay organised as the game keeps track of previously guessed letters, preventing players from making duplicate guesses and enhancing the overall gaming experience.

- Winning and Losing Conditions: To achieve victory, players must successfully guess the entire word, while running out of lives results in defeat, adding suspense and motivation to the game.

## Instructions

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Ensure you have the latest version of Python installed.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the milestone_5.py script: ```python3 milstone_5.py``` 

- Follow the on-screen instructions:
    1. You will be prompted to guess a letter or type 'quit' to exit the game.
    2. If you enter an invalid input (more than one character or a letter you've already guessed), you will receive appropriate feedback.
    3. The game will display the guessed letters, the hidden word with blanks, and the remaining lives.
    4. Keep guessing letters until you correctly guess the word or run out of lives.
